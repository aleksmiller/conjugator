        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Conjugator ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information 
          when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information 
          in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          
          <h3>Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Conjugator is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable 
            information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or location data.
          </p>

          <h3>App Usage Data</h3>
          <p>
            The App stores data locally on your device only. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Verbs you mark as favorites are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage.</li>
            <li><strong>Theme Preferences:</strong> Your theme preference (light/dark/system) is stored locally on your device.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.
          </p>

          <h3>No Analytics or Tracking</h3>
          <p>
            We do not use any analytics services, tracking tools, or third-party data collection services. We do not track 
            your app usage, screen views, or any other behavioral data.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data to use or share. All data stored by the 
            App (favorites and theme preferences) is used solely to provide you with a personalized experience within the App 
            and remains on your device.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
          <p>
            All data associated with the App is stored locally on your device using secure local storage mechanisms provided 
            by your operating system. We do not maintain any servers or databases that store your information.

          <p>
            The security of your data depends on the security of your device. We recommend that you:
          </p>

          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            The App does not integrate with any third-party services that collect personal information. The App uses only 
            standard React Native and Expo libraries for core functionality, which do not collect or transmit personal data.
